                        It was honestly quite hard for me to select my &quot;Relationship&quot; to Matt. Over the years, our connection has evolved and expanded; we've 
                        been classmates, colleagues, and most recently, I had the pleasure of introducing him to the world of coding.

                        At Discovery World, he reported directly to me. He proved himself to be a standout team player and the most consistent and 
                        reliable person on my team. His commitment to going the above and beyond not only made him a joy to work alongside but also
                        brought our team's overall efficiency and productivity to another level.

                        A memorable day that comes to mind is when we found ourselves shouldering the entire operation, just the two of us, where 
                        normally we would have a team of 4-6 (with an absolute bare minimum of 3). Despite the dire circumstances on top of an 
                        unusually busy day, we ran the operation smoothly and efficiently. I attribute this seamless day primarily to Matt's ability 
                        to step up and take charge, showing his true mettle under pressure. This should've been one of the hardest days of my career 
                        at Discovery World, but I actually think back on it fondly.

                        He may not have a traditional university education, but his strong analytical mind, firm grasp of logic, and latent ability far
                        outshine any conventional credential. Passing up on the chance to cultivate his limitless potential would be a seriously 
                        missed opportunity.

                        I wholeheartedly endorse Matt for his abilities and potential. I am always available to provide a more detailed reference if 
                        needed, should any doubt remain. Rest assured, he is a safe bet for any team.

                    <Testimonial reference="Although Matthew and I didn't directly work together on a project, he was great to share a classroom with. He has 
                    shown his receptiveness to every topic and asking thoughtful questions. His capstone project shown his passion of programming along with 
                    sports. Matthew's capstone brought an aspect to the sport's world by allowing the audience to choose the victor, rather than the standard 
                    judge ruling. 

                    I believe Matthew will provide an excellent addition into any team by his professionalism, team work capabilities and knowledge gained

                        Matthew has a real hunger for learning and software development. Time after time, he would finish his work early and reach out for 
                        more to continue building his knowledge on more concepts. His thoughtful questions lead to many great discussions. He has a great eye
                        for both frontend design and backend structure, which he showcased by building an impressive full-stack capstone project. 
                        Matthew also showed great compassion for his peers, and was an excellent collaborator. He would make a fantastic addition to any team!

                    ideas to the table and incorporated the best ones into our finished solution. 

                    Matthew demonstrated advanced coding skill from early on. His Capstone did not disappoint. His project had some unique styling that I had 
                    not seen in any other project. The concept was original and entertaining and the execution was on-point. 

                    I am not only a classmate of Matt, but a fan. I look forward to downloading his finished projects as they are released to market in the
